Table Explorer
==============
HTML tables parsing made easy.

__Why?__ Because parsing tables with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is not easy due to the fact that table cells have unexpected indexes when cells use the `colspan` or `rowspan` attributes.

This library intends to make parsing and navigating into HTML table way easier, especially when some cells span multiple columns or rows.
